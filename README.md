# 📊 Leicester City Council Data Visualization🚀

### **🔍 Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data related to the Leicester City Council to understand public sentiment, engagement patterns, and trending topics. Using Python and various data processing libraries, I collected and cleaned Twitter data, applied machine learning models for sentiment analysis, and built a web-based dashboard to visualize key insights. The main goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the council improve public engagement and communication strategies.
The data was processed using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, NLTK and TextBlob for natural language processing (NLP), and SMOTE for handling imbalanced datasets. For sentiment classification, I implemented logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes, comparing their accuracy to select the best-performing model. The final analysis showed that most tweets were neutral, with a significant percentage of negative interactions related to policy discussions and budget concerns.
To present these insights interactively, I developed a web dashboard using Flask, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to explore sentiment trends, word clouds, and engagement metrics. The dashboard provides filter options for tweet count, sentiment type, and timeline analysis. The project is structured for easy deployment and future enhancements, such as integrating real-time Twitter streaming, additional social media platforms, and advanced NLP techniques like BERT for improved sentiment analysis.
This repository includes all relevant code for data collection, processing, sentiment analysis, and visualization. To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the Flask app locally. Future improvements can focus on enhancing the user interface, expanding data sources, and refining sentiment classification for more accurate insights
